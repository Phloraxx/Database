Resistance = rho L/A
G (Conductance) = 1/R = I / V

Determine Degree of Dissocoation , = Am/ A^0m

Ka = Cx^2 / 1-alpha

Nernst Equation:   
![[Pasted image 20230111080909.png]] N=number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction
                                                      Z= is the number of moles
Anode    = Oxidises = Loses electron
Cathode = reduces = gains electron

Change in Gibbs energy = -nF Ecell

Faraday  I : m=zQ  (W = Z I t)
Faraday II : W1/E1 = W2/E2 = W3/E
Am = 1000 x K / Molarity
