Coordination compounds are molecules or ions composed of a metal atom or ion bonded to one or more ligands

Ligands are molecules or ions that bind to a central atom in a coordination complex. They can be either monodentate, bidentate, or multidentate

Chelating ligands are molecules that can form multiple bonds with a central metal atom or ion. (Ring like Structure)

Oxidation number of a coordination compound is the charge that an atom in the compound would have if the compound were completely ionic.
