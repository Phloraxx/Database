Average Rate is obtained by dividing the change in concentraion of any of the reactant or product by the time taken for the change.

Average Rate becoms Instantaneous rate as Delta T ---> 0

Rate Law describes the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentrations of reactants.

**Rate constant** is the rate of reaction when the concentration of each of reacting species is unity. It is represented by ‘k’ It is also called specific reaction rate or velocity constant of reaction.

**Order of reaction** is defined as the sum of the exponents to which the concentration terms are raised in the rate equation (or rate law) of the reaction

Molecularity is the number of molecules taking part in a single elementary reaction step.

A zero order reaction is a chemical reaction in which the rate of the reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactants.
