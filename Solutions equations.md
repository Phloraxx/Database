1. Molarity (M): M = moles of solute/Liter of solution 
2. Molality (m): m = moles of solute/kilogram of solvent 
3. Parts Per Million (ppm): ppm = parts of solute/million parts of solution 
4. Percent (%) : % = grams of solute/100 grams of solution
5. Mass/Volume Percent: Mass/Volume % = mass of solute/volume of solution 
6. Mole Fraction: Mole Fraction = moles of solute/total moles of solution  
7. Volume/Volume Percent: Volume/Volume % = volume of solute/volume of solution

  Raoults Law :                            P=X1P1+X2P2
  Henrys Law:                              P=Kh x X
  Elevation of Boiling Point :       Change in T = Kb x m
  Depression in Freezing Point:  Change in T = Kf x m
  Osmotic Pressure:                    pi =  CRT
