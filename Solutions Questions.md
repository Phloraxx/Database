Mass of solute x 100 / Mass of solution = Mass percentage of solute        ( 1 - mass % of solute = mass of solvent)

Mass / Molar mass = No. of moles 

Mole Fraction = Moles of solute / Moles of solution  ( 1 - moles of solute = moles of solvent)



Van Hoesch factor related with degree of association.        -   alpha= i-1/n-1




Warm solution - Exothermic - Negative Deviation
Colde solution - Endothermic - Positive Deviation

Lowering of Vapour Pressure causes Depression in Freezing Point, Increase in Boiling point.

Lower Boiling Point = More volatile = Higher Vapour Pressure

Molal elevation constant - increase in temperature proportional to the number of particles (solid) dissolved.

Molal depression constant - decrease in freezing point when molality is 1

Minimum Boiling Azeotrope - Large Positive Deviation (Water+Ethanol)
