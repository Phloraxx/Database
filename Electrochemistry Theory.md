Resistivity (rho) = Resistance of conductor with 1m length and 1 m^2 area.

Cell constant is a property of a conductivity cell, and it is the ratio of the cell's length to its cross-sectional area.

Molar conductivity is a measure of the ability of an electrolyte solution to conduct electricity. It is expressed as the conductivity of a solution containing one mole of a dissolved substance per liter of solution

Limiting Molar Conductivity is the Conductivity at infinite dilution.

For Strong electrolytes : Molar Conductivity increases slowly with dilution due to increase in the movement of ions on dilution.   Am = A^0m - Ac^(1/2)

For Weak electrolytes : Molar Conductivity increases steeply with dilution due to increase in the number of ions

Kohlrausch law of independent migration of ions :  infinite dilution, the conductivity of an electrolyte solution is equal to the addition of conductivity of both ions.

EMF is the potential difference between two electrodes when no current is drawn

Faradays First Law : amount of substance produced by electrolysis is proportional to the amount of electric charge passed through the electrolyte.

Faradys Second Law : If same quantity of electricity is passed through electrolytic solution, subsgtance deposited are directly proportional to thier chemical equivalent weight.
