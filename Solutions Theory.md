Solution is a homogenous mixture of two or more pure substances whose compositions may be altered within certain limits

Henrys law states that at any given time the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressur eof gas over the solution

Raoult's law states that the vapor pressure of a liquid solution is equal to the vapor pressure of its components multiplied by their mole fraction.

Azeotrope: type of mixture with a constant boiling point where the components cannot be separated by distillation.

Colligative properties are physical properties of solutions that depend on the number of solute particles present, rather than on the nature of the solute itself.

Solubility is the maximum amount of substances dissolved in a specified amount of solvent at a given temperature.

Osmosis is the flow of  solvent molecules from pure solvent to solution through semi permeable membrane.

Osmotic Pressure is the minimum pressure that must be applied on the solution side to prevent flow of solvent into the solution through a semi permeable membrane.
